# Radio Player built in React and ES6 with Sveriges Radio's open API. :radio:

Responsive Radio Player built in React and JavaScript ES6. Bringing in streaming live radio using Sveriges Radioâ€™s open API. A search field lets the user filter channels by name and description. Clicking the old radio in desktop mode gives the site a retro look, and the little clickable icon up on the right is a tip of the hat to another radio themed culture phenomenon.
